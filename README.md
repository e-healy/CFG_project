# CFG_project

This project was tasked by our instructors Sam and Jude on the CFG Web Development Kickstarter. We were tasked to create a website of our choice, that combines HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## How it works

Travellers can use this website to learn more about hidden gem destinations around the globe. Each team member picked a city/place that they had an affinity for and created a destination page for it, with fun quizzes, top places to visit and cool facts.

## What I learned

This was my first ever Web Development project and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not only did I enjoy collaborating with great team members, but I also worked diligently to expand my skillset so that this project could really shine. One thing I was proud of was my quiz for the Seville destination page, a 5 question quiz made with JavaScript to test the user's knowledge of the city.

To add, it was fun to learn more about Bootstrap framework, which was used to create the fundamental, interactive elements within the landing page's wireframe, such as a carousel of locations, an offcanvas navigation bar, as well as destination cards to explore.
